The pywebsocket project aims to provide a
[WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) standalone server and a
WebSocket extension for [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/),
mod\_pywebsocket.

This version is no longer maintained. It has been superceded by
[pywebsocket3](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pywebsocket3) which works
with Python 3 in additional to Python 2.

Most existing users should migrate to pywebsocket3.

Support for running as an Apache module has been dropped in pywebsocket3. If you
need an Apache WebSocket module, you should look for an alternate solution.

pywebsocket is intended for **testing** or **experimental** purposes.
